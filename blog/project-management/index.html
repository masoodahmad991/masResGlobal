Few of my thoughts on how to manage your next project offshore!
</p>
<p>
The biggest problem with low cost offshore consultancy firms is lack of communication skills. “You get what you pay for” usually turns out correct. There should be dedicated technical project manager whose core skills are to be effective communicator, in-depth understanding of project requirements, collaborating with developers and making sure the quality and timeline of project turns out as per expectations. So clients be hassle free all the time; every time.

Software, even the tiniest most simplest thing should not be ever built without an expert’s advice. Junior staff can ruin things and you don’t even get to know that until it's too late. With this philosophy, before even the plan of action is made for any project, each and everything should go through expert solutions architects. From high level to details, instructions and notes be shared with all stakeholders to make sure the project is optimized and never ends as a disaster.

Unclear expectations can destroy repute, lead to misunderstandings and a business loss as well. Once requirements and plans are agreed, there needs to be a “detailed document” be written on paper and well communicated. This statement of work consists of work breakdown structure, timelines, project scope, future support and any priorities that would be dear to you. This ensures all stakeholders understand expectations well ahead of time.

I think every task should be reviewed by another person apart from the initial assignee. Hence in a separate and dedicated quality assurance team that scans through pixels to each line of code and over all architecture, performance and usability.

Following at least semi or mostly agile methodologies. Using modern project management tools for organizing and planning, daily scrum meetings, updating all stakeholders, weekly demos of in-action milestone to clients, be a daily routine.

I suggest you never pay big amounts upfront to vendors. Always check their processes, full project cycle and quality by first engaging for a minimum viable product or smallest app you can think of.
